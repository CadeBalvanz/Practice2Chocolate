1.What is the overall number of chocolate bars rated?
2.How does the number of ratings depend on the year? Draw a bar chart of the number of reports.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
choco <- read.csv("https://ds202-at-isu.github.io/labs/data/choco.csv")
head(choco)

choco %>% ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(Review.Date))) +
  geom_bar() +xlab('Year')+ylab('Number of Reviews')+ ggtitle('Number of Reviews by Year')
```

From head(choco), we can see that there are 1852 ratings.

From the bar plot, we can see that interest in reviewing chocolates peaked in 2015, and has tapered off since.
